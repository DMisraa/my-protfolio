<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi ! </br>
  My name is Daniel, 29 years old from Tel Aviv. </br>
  Since I've finished my army days I have been involved in the real estate world, </br>
  from brokering residential apartments to investments in commercial properties. </br>
  In a quast for my next challenge, wanting to expand my knowlage toolbox I've decided </br>
  I'ts time for me to understand the world of coding, learning how design and build a </br>
  web page for my business I was running at the time. I've learned that the world of </br>
  of coding fascinates me and I've been coding ever since. </br>
  Business develompment oriented, I am self-motivated with a relentless drive for </br>
  success, focused on goals and objectives.
